pip install -r requirements.txt

export FLASK_APP=change_table.py
# this is optional, but recommended for debugging
# If you are running flask on your own machine you might want to use add `--debug` flag in the `flask run` command
# instead of the FLASK_ENV environment variable.
export FLASK_ENV=development 

# before running the following, change the port number
# so that no two users use the same number
flask run --port=PORT

Observations regarding project:
------------------------------------------------------------
Data for the project seemed relevant however since the data were concatenated data from different years and sources,
I had to be careful wtih handling it. The gpd per capita numbers did not fully correspond with the real time 
values however it seemed like they were roughly 2x of the real value, so I kept them as they were.

During the process I found out that GPD did not really correlate with the number of suicides per year, although in some countries
like Republic of Korea, there was an interesting small correlation that with increase of GDP increased also number of suicides.
However increase in population did correlate but that is obvious. 

Another aspect I found that out of all suicides 
men commit roughly 76.5% of them, which is a significant number compared to "only" 23.5% with women.

In the aspect of age, most suicides are commited at the age of 35-54 years.
Most suicides were commited in 1999, most suicides in 1 year were commited in 1994 in Russia it was 61420.
Most suicides for gender it was male in Russia 1994 22338.
